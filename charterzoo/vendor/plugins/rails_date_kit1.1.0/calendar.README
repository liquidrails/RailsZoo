Lightweight JavaScript calendar control
=======================================
v1.1.0, Stuart Rackham

Inspired by Swazz Javascript Calendar v 1.0 by Oliver Bryant
(http://calendar.swazz.org). The look and feel is a blatant copy of the Swazz
Calendar but the underlying code has been completely rewritten by Stuart
Rackham to make it play nicely with Rails along with some additional features:

- Allow dates prior to the current date to be selected.
- The appearence is factored into a separate CSS file.
- Todays date is highlighed red.
- Calendar images directory can be set with images_dir option.
- The date display format can be customized with calendar format option.
- The month names can be customized with month_names option.
- The week day names can be customized with day_names option.
- Positions correctly in XHTML 1.0 pages and HTML 4.0.1 STRICT pages.
- Private functions and objects wrapped in an anonymous namespace (only
  one function is exposed).
- A keypress in the input element hides the calendar.

See the CHANGELOG new features added since the first release.

Tested with Firefox 2, IE6, IE7.

for JavaScript namespace technique.

Browser Idiosyncrasies::
- Konqueror 3.5.5: If multiple calendars are in adjacent <tr> elements clicking
  the next/prev buttons pops up the calendar in the next row.
- Konqueror 3.5.5: Under some conditions (seems to be inside tables) the
  calendar left and bottom borders are not displayed.
